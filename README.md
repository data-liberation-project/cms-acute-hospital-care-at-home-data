# CMS Acute Hospital Care at Home (AHCAH) Data

This repository contains data, obtained by the Data Liberation Project via FOIA, on:

- The hospitals that have applied for [Acute Hospital Care at Home](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QThzzfaGWwq-RDd7fvQpTuUKJozBuQZJiFhcKt1ONX4/edit) (AHCAH) waivers
- The [metrics](https://qualitynet.cms.gov/acute-hospital-care-at-home/measures) that AHCAH-providing hospitals must report weekly/monthly to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)

Please [register here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSed3bOZxgNwgMKGQIdPHsb8my4m1b-puK92pySui3EW6Xmkbw/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.585356262=https%3a%2f%2fwww.data-liberation-project.org%2fdatasets%2fcms-acute-hospital-care-at-home-data%2f) to receive updates regarding these records.

## Background

Please read the Data Liberation Project's [documentation for this project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QThzzfaGWwq-RDd7fvQpTuUKJozBuQZJiFhcKt1ONX4/edit) for context.

## Raw data

The [`data/raw/`](data/raw) directory contains the records provided by CMS on October 2, 2023:

The four spreadsheets correspond to:

- Tier 1 waivers
- Tier 2 waivers
- Tier 1 measures
- Tier 2 measures

Several aspects of those spreadsheets cause them to be less than ideal to work with and analyze, including:

- Some column names are incredibly long
- Columns are in an unintuitive order
- Date fields are unconventionally formatted
- Data contains some empty and/or "test" rows

## Standardized data

The [`data/cleaned/`](data/cleaned) directory contains the same data, but cleaned up to fix the issues above. Specifically:

- Long column names are abbreviated
- Measure columns are auto-abbreviated to "`m_{measure_id}`"
- Other columns are renamed, for consistency's sake (e.g., "city" -> "hospital_city")
- All column names are standardized to "`snake_case`"
- Column order is standardized
- Date fields are standardized to `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Empty and "test" rows are removed

All manual renamings can be found in the file [`data/manual/column-renames.csv`](data/manual/column-renames.csv).

All the code to conduct the standardization can be found in [`scripts/00-standardize.py`](scripts/00-standardize.py).

## Cleaned data

The [`data/cleaned/`](data/cleaned) contains the Data Liberation Project’s current attempt at cleaning hospital names, removing duplicate submissions of the reporting measures, removing clearly erroneous waiver request submissions, and removing a few non-core columns.

All the code to conduct the standardization can be found in [`scripts/01-clean.py`](scripts/01-clean.py).

## Data dictionary

CMS has provided a [data dictionary for the records](https://github.com/data-liberation-project/cms-acute-hospital-care-at-home-data/blob/main/docs/AHCAH%20Jira%20Data%20Dictionary.xlsx), with column descriptions corresponding to each CSV.

## Data interpretation and limitations

Please consult the Data Liberation Project's [core documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QThzzfaGWwq-RDd7fvQpTuUKJozBuQZJiFhcKt1ONX4/edit) for these records to understand their context and limitations.

## Changes in initial vs. updated records

The Data Liberation Project received an initial set of responsive records in June 2023, and published them in July 2023. Those files were useful, but suboptimal in several ways:

- Measure 1c was missing for Tier 1 hospital's submitted measures
- The status and submission dates of each waiver request and measures submissions were missing
- The raw records contained internal identifiers that the Data Liberation Project decided, out of an abundance of caution regarding potential security issues, not to release

On October 2, 2023, CMS provided an updated set of records, which feature several improvements:

- Measure 1c issue is fixed
- Records now contain submission dates and statuses
- Raw records no longer contain those internal identifiers, allowing the Data Liberation Project to share the new records in their entirety
- Records contain submissions received through September 14, 2023 — five additional months of data

Note: The records no longer contain hospital hospital staff contact information.
