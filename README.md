# CMS Acute Hospital Care at Home (AHCAH) Data

This repository contains data, obtained by the Data Liberation Project via FOIA, on:

- The hospitals that have applied for [Acute Hospital Care at Home](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QThzzfaGWwq-RDd7fvQpTuUKJozBuQZJiFhcKt1ONX4/edit) (AHCAH) waivers
- The [metrics](https://qualitynet.cms.gov/acute-hospital-care-at-home/measures) that AHCAH-providing hospitals must report weekly/monthly to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)

## Background

Please read the Data Liberation Project's [documentation for this project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QThzzfaGWwq-RDd7fvQpTuUKJozBuQZJiFhcKt1ONX4/edit) for context.

## Raw/redacted data

__Note__: The Data Liberation Project is initially not releasing the fully-raw records, out of an abundance of caution regarding a potential (but not confirmed) security issue. The DLP has raised this issue directly with CMS, and is waiting to hear back. Fortunately, the aspects of concern are ancillary to the core data, and should not affect the records’ usability. Please [register here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSed3bOZxgNwgMKGQIdPHsb8my4m1b-puK92pySui3EW6Xmkbw/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.585356262=https%3a%2f%2fwww.data-liberation-project.org%2fdatasets%2fcms-acute-hospital-care-at-home-data%2f) to receive updates regarding the raw data.

The [`data/redacted/`](data/redacted) directory contains the records provided by CMS, with only one change: replacing numeric “issue” identifiers (e.g., “AHCAH-12345”) with “AHCAH-***”.

The four spreadsheets correspond to:

- Tier 1 waivers
- Tier 2 waivers
- Tier 1 measures
- Tier 2 measures

Several aspects of those spreadsheets cause them to be less than ideal to work with and analyze, including:

- Some column names are incredibly long
- Some columns are repeated for each instance of an observation (e.g., each "outward issue")
- The Tier 1 measures file slightly shifts formats after the 1,000th row, and includes a new header after that row

## Standardized data

The [`data/cleaned/`](data/cleaned) directory contains the same data, but cleaned up to fix the issues above. Specifically:

- Long column names are abbreviated
- Measure columns are auto-abbreviated to "`m_{measure_id}`"
- Other columns are renamed, for consistency's sake (e.g., "city" -> "hospital_city")
- All column names are standardized to "`snake_case`"
- Date fields are standardized to `YYYY-MM-DD`
- The "Outward Issue" and "Inward Issue" columns are condensed into one column each, listing all values for the associated repeated columns, ` • `-separated
- The specific issue with the Tier 1 measures file is fixed
- Empty and "test" rows are removed

All manual renamings can be found in the file [`data/manual/column-renames.csv`](data/manual/column-renames.csv).

All the code to conduct the standardization can be found in [`scripts/00-standardize.py`](scripts/00-standardize.py).

## Cleaned data

The [`data/cleaned/`](data/cleaned) contains the Data Liberation Project’s current attempt at cleaning hospital names, removing duplicate submissions of the reporting measures, removing clearly erroneous waiver request submissions, and removing non-core columns.

All the code to conduct the standardization can be found in [`scripts/01-clean.py`](scripts/01-clean.py).

## Data interpretation and limitations

Please consult the Data Liberation Project's [core documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QThzzfaGWwq-RDd7fvQpTuUKJozBuQZJiFhcKt1ONX4/edit) for these records to understand their context and limitations.
