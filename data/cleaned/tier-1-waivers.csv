The clinical team identified COVID positive patients that could be cared for in their home with a daily virtual visit from a provider and a phone call from a nurse.  To date the team has treated 62 patients that where admitted and then discharged and 22 patients enrolled from the Emergency Department these have all been COVID positive patients.  The first non COVID patients are being enrolled starting on March 18, 2021.  We are now expanding our program to include the guidelines outlined by CMS that will include the two daily visits by a paramedic to obtain vital signs including include heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and temperature. Vital signs will be documented in the electronic medical record. Patients will be enrolled to the Hospital Care at Home program directly from the Emergency Department or to complete a hospital stay.  The patient being discharged from the Emergency Department will receive an in person visit by a hospitalist, that will assess the patient and complete a history and physical that will be utilized in the Hospital Care at Home Program.  For patients that are being admitted after a hospital stay UHS will use the admitting history and physical and the attending physician will do a hand off to the Hospital Care at Home Provider.  Once the patient is in the Hospital Care at Home Program the patient will be seen via virtual visit or in person visit, if warranted.  The Hospital Care at Home patients will be tracked in the electronic medical record so all members of the interdisciplinary team will know which patients are enrolled in the program.  In the UHS Hospital Care at Home Program there will be dedicated paramedic, RN and Physician resources assigned to each patient.  The paramedics will go to the patient’s home twice a day to obtain vital signs, assist in obtaining any needed information or assessments and provide patient/family education and support as needed.  The RN assigned to the Hospital Care at Home patient will provide a virtual visit with the patient daily.  The assigned physician will also perform a daily virtual visit.  UHS has capabilities to have a Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy either virtually or in the home and capability for Speech Language-Pathologists virtually.  During calendar year 2020, the United Health Services system provided care to 104,495 patients utilizing a virtual modality.  UHS has a HiTrust Certified platform to connect the clinical team with our patients.  Virtual health became a necessity during the COVID pandemic to serve the patients in our community.  The feedback from patients enrolled in Hospital Care at Home has been positive.  UHS has dedicated resources specifically to the Hospital Care at Home program. UHS is capable to care for patients safely in their home with the experience learned from treating COVID positive patient in their home and the available resources with Population Health, virtual visits and Emergency Services in Broome County.",,Kay_Boland@nyuhs.org,Kay Boland,607-763-6694,Chief Nursing Officer,"{""id"":1,""name"":""IJ data for prior 2 years reviewed."",""mandatory"":true,""rank"":0,""statusId"":""none"",""dueDate"":null,""isHeader"":false,""checked"":true,""priorityId"":null,""assigneeIds"":[],""globalItemId"":16408,""version"":""5.0"",""linkedIssueKey"":null}",Acute Hospital Care at Home - Tier 1,ess_service_account,CCN 330394: Acute Hospital Care at Home Waiver Request,Kim.Brady@nyuhs.org,Kimberly Brady,607-221-6043
